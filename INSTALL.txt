Scalar Installation Instructions
--------------------------------

Scalar is a PHP and MySQL application built with CodeIgniter.
 
*** 
An important note on .htaccess:
For Scalar to work properly, it is essential that mod_rewrite -- .htaccess -- be enabled in your Apache config.
If .htaccess is not enabled, Scalar's URL rewriting will not operate; you'll know this is the case because clicking
on links such as 'sign in' or 'register' will not take you to those pages (rather, the home page will reload).
In addition, some FTP clients will interpret .htaccess as a hidden file and not copy them to the server by default.  
There are a few .htaccess files included in the Scalar build, therefore please make sure that these files are copied.
***

***
If PHP's short_open_tag (<? vs <?php) is turned off, CodeIgniter is supposed to make them operational, but this feature doesn't
seem to be working properly.  Please make sure short_open_tag is turned on in PHP. Scalar also requires the non-default PHP extension mbstring. 
See installation instructions for mbstring http://php.net/manual/en/mbstring.installation.php.
***

***
You can download the most recent Scalar build from GitHub. However, we also occassionally package Scalar into a GitHub Release,
downloadable at https://github.com/anvc/scalar/releases. Installing from a release ensures that the Scalar team has tested its contents on development and 
live environments (e.g., scalar.usc.edu).  To update an existing Scalar install, see UPDATE.txt.
***

1) 

Run the SQL script on a fresh MySQL database (e.g., "scalar_store"):

system/application/config/scalar_store.sql

Note that five additional tables will be added after Scalar's first use.

Update database fields (hostname, database, username and password) at:

system/application/config/database.php

2)

Add a new SALT string, reCAPTCHA key (for your domain, http://www.google.com/recaptcha/whyrecaptcha), 
registration key, SoundCloud key, and a few other keys:

system/application/config/local_settings.php

Add session encryption key ($config['encryption_key']) and cookie/session variable ($config['cookie_prefix']) at:

system/application/config/config.php

3) 

By default, the home page (book index) will display "Scalar" as the page title; this can be updated at:

system/application/language/en/content_lang.php

4) 

All should be set to visit your site at its URL and see a basic home page with the Scalar title at left and login at right.

If you experience MySQL connection problems (say, there was a typo in the the connection parameters), correct, then refresh your page,
you might notice an error from Session.php involving num_rows().  In this case, clear your browser cache & cookies and refresh.

5) 

You can register your new account using the 'register' link.

To make your user (after it is registered) a "super admin", requires direct access to MySQL (e.g., phpMyAdmin). In the database table
"scalar_db_users" edit your user row then set the "is_super" bit to 1. After refreshing Scalar, you will have access to all
Scalar books and additional admin tabs in the "Dashboard" area

Note that even super admins can't save changes to others' books unless they are explicitly provided "author" privilege in
the "Users" tab of the book's "Dashboard" area.

Enjoy!

My customisations for Warwick:
- grab from digihum github repo
- need to AllowOverride All in httpd.conf
- need to add LoadModule rewrite... to httpd.conf
- need to change short_open_tag to on in /etc/php.d/zzz....
- need to restart both php and httpd with sudo systemctl restart php-fpm
